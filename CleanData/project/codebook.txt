Variables

raw_labels - A list of activity label definitions. The definition contains an numeric id value and a text description.
labels - A data frame of activity label definitions. First column is id and the second column is description.
raw_features - A vector of meansurement features.
tmp_features - A list of meansurement feature definitions. Only contains mean and standard deviation features. The definition contains an numeric id value and a text description.
features - A data frame of mean and standard deviation feature definitions. First column is id and the second column is description.
raw_train_subject - A vector of the subject id value for the training measurement.
raw_train_activity - A vector of the activity id value for the training measurement.
raw_train_data - A vector of the training measurement data.
raw_test_subject - A vector of the subject id value for the testing measurement.
raw_test_activity - A vector of the activity id value for the testing measurement.
raw_test_data - A vector of the testing measurement data.
merged_data - A matrix of combined training and testing meansurement data.
filtered_data - A matrix of conbined training and testing meansurement data having only mean and standard deviation features values
final_data - A data frame of cleaned up data. It has 3 key columns - sid, aid and activity and data columns for each mean and standard deviation feature readings. sid is subject id. aid is activity id. activity is activity description. 

Output

mean_data - a data frame of tidy data set with average of each feature for each activity and each subject
